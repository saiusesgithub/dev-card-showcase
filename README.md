## 🛠 How to Contribute

### Step 1: Prepare your Image
**⚠️ IMPORTANT IMAGE RULES:**
1. **Aspect Ratio:** Your image MUST be a square (**1:1 ratio**)
2. **File Format:** `.jpg` or `.png` only
3. **Naming:** Name the file exactly as your username (e.g., `john-doe.jpg`)
4. **Size:** Please keep image size under **500KB**

### Step 2: Fork & Clone
1. Star this repository (Optional, but highly recommended)
2. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
3. Clone it to your local machine:

   ```

### Step 3: Add your Code
1. Add your image file into the `images/` folder
2. Open `index.html`
3. Locate the comment **`👇 CONTRIBUTORS: START COPYING FROM HERE 👇`**
4. Copy the template code block
5. Paste it at the **bottom** of the list (above the closing tags)
6. Update the `src=""`, `<h2>`, `<span class="role">`, and `<p>` tags with your details

**Example:**
```html
<div class="card">
    <img src="images/john-doe.jpg" alt="John's Photo" class="card-img">
    <h2>John Doe</h2>
    <span class="role">Frontend Wizard</span>
    <p>"Hello world! This is my first PR."</p>

## 🎨 Custom Styles (Optional)
If you want to change the background color of only your card:
